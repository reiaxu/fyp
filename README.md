EIE3 BEng Final Year Project - When does quantisation work?

This repository contains code that implements post-training quantisation given the state dictionaries of pre-trained CNN models (.pt files) which were not able to be uploaded due to GitHub file upload constraints. This repository also contains code that uses the Xilinx Brevitas research library to implement int-8 and binary quantisation-aware training.
